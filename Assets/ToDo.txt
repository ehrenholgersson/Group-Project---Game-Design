Other Assesments:

AI

	AGENTS

		Humanoid, limited movement, highest speed, needs keys to open doors to progress

		Ogre, - can wade through water due to height, smashes some obstacles (these obstacles ignored on their navmesh and have triggers to destory on collision)

		Spider, able to jump over some obstacles, or onto top of walls

	OBSTACLES

		water (plane at set level) - deep or shallow, Ogre able to traverse shallow - probably using navmesh modifier volumes at ste heights to implememnt this

		walls - breakable or not, Ogre can traverse through breakable and this will "destroy" them so that ather agents can then traverse. depending on height spider can jump onto
		
		lava - just not part of the navmesh (AI will not traverse)

	BEHAVIOURS

		 human - always move to next "objective" (key door or exit) - agent must collect "key" in areas to progress, agent has a "panic" level which determines if they go for the treasure

		Ogre, will move in general direction of human (pick random point within x distance of human), if within "hearing" range (just a set distance)  then this is more accurate, if within line of site ogre moves directly to player

		spider will patrol within a set distance of their starting location unless line of site is obtained to human, if no line of site will continue to last seen position then resume patrol unless line of site is reestablished
